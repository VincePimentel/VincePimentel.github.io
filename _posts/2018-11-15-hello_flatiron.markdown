One day during my 2nd year in high school, my computer teacher asked the class for someone who could represent the school in a web design competition. No one volunteered so we all moved on to that day's lesson. I was not surprised that no one did because having your own computer at home to even learn anything about programming and apply what you've been taught at school was rare where I grew up, the Philippines. You could go to an internet cafe (PC bang) and rent one hourly but that was going to be pretty expensive... 

And so I did. After thinking about it during class, I approached my teacher right after and volunteered to join. He supplied me with some books and was permitted to use the computer lab until school closes but I only really had an hour or two - school starts at 7AM and ends at 5PM then everything closes at 7PM so I had to rent a computer during the night.

After studying up HTML, CSS and some JavaScript for about two weeks, I realized how much I loved the act of connecting words and symbols to create something that you could see and interact with.

It was the day of competition, I remembered using PowerPoint to create buttons with gradients and save them as images while my competition used these graphics editors.

While I did not win, this whole thing introduced me to something that I would end up chasing. Fast forward several years, here I am today.
